IAS 10 Events After The Reporting Period contains requirements for when events after the end of the reporting period should be adjusted in the financial statements. Adjusting events are those providing evidence of conditions existing at the end of the reporting period, whereas non-adjusting events are indicative of conditions arising after the reporting period (the latter being disclosed where material).

IAS 10 was reissued in December 2003 and applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.

Non-adjusting events should be disclosed if they are of such importance that non-disclosure would affect the ability of users to make proper evaluations and decisions. The required disclosure is:
