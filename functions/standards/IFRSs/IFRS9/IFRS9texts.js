IFRS 9 Financial Instruments issued on 24 July 2014 is the IASB's replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The Standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting. The IASB completed its project to replace IAS 39 in phases, adding to the standard as it completed each phase.

The version of IFRS 9 issued in 2014 supersedes all previous versions and is mandatorily effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted (subject to local endorsement requirements). For a limited period, previous versions of IFRS 9 may be adopted early if not already done so provided the relevant date of initial application is before 1 February 2015.

IFRS 9 does not replace the requirements for portfolio fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk (often referred to as the ‘macro hedge accounting’ requirements) since this phase of the project was separated from the IFRS 9 project due to the longer term nature of the macro hedging project which is currently at the discussion paper phase of the due process. In April 2014, the IASB published a Discussion Paper Accounting for Dynamic Risk management: a Portfolio Revaluation Approach to Macro Hedging. Consequently, the exception in IAS 39 for a fair value hedge of an interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities continues to apply.

All financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. [IFRS 9, paragraph 5.1.1]

IFRS 9 divides all financial assets that are currently in the scope of IAS 39 into two classifications - those measured at amortised cost and those measured at fair value.

Where assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised entirely in profit or loss (fair value through profit or loss, FVTPL), or recognised in other comprehensive income (fair value through other comprehensive income, FVTOCI).

For debt instruments the FVTOCI classification is mandatory for certain assets unless the fair value option is elected. Whilst for equity investments, the FVTOCI classification is an election. Furthermore, the requirements for reclassifying gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are different for debt instruments and equity investments.

The classification of a financial asset is made at the time it is initially recognised, namely when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. [IFRS 9, paragraph 4.1.1] If certain conditions are met, the classification of an asset may subsequently need to be reclassified.

debtInstruments:`
A debt instrument that meets the following two conditions must be measured at amortised cost (net of any write down for impairment) unless the asset is designated at FVTPL under the fair value option (see below):[IFRS 9, paragraph 4.1.2]

Business model test: The objective of the entity's business model is to hold the financial asset to collect the contractual cash flows (rather than to sell the instrument prior to its contractual maturity to realise its fair value changes). 
Cash flow characteristics test: The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Assessing the cash flow characteristics also includes an analysis of changes in the timing or in the amount of payments. It is necessary to assess whether the cash flows before and after the change represent only repayments of the nominal amount and an interest rate based on them.

The right of termination may for example be in accordance with the cash flow condition if, in the case of termination, the only outstanding payments consist of principal and interest on the principal amount and an appropriate compensation payment where applicable. In October 2017, the IASB clarified that the compensation payments can also have a negative sign.*

*Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9); to be applied retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2019; early application permitted

A debt instrument that meets the following two conditions must be measured at FVTOCI unless the asset is designated at FVTPL under the fair value option: [IFRS 9, paragraph 4.1.2A]
- Business model test: The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
- Cash flow characteristics test: The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
All other debt instruments must be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). [IFRS 9, paragraph 4.1.4]

FVoption:`
Even if an instrument meets the two requirements to be measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI, IFRS 9 contains an option to designate, at initial recognition, a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an 'accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases. [IFRS 9, paragraph 4.1.5]

IFRS 9 contains an option to designate a financial liability as measured at FVTPL if [IFRS 9, paragraph 4.2.2]:
- doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an 'accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases, or
- the liability is part or a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities that is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the entity's key management personnel.

A financial liability which does not meet any of these criteria may still be designated as measured at FVTPL when it contains one or more embedded derivatives that sufficiently modify the cash flows of the liability and are not clearly closely related. [IFRS 9, paragraph 4.3.5]

IFRS 9 requires gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as at FVTPL to be split into the amount of change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk of the liability, presented in other comprehensive income, and the remaining amount presented in profit or loss. The new guidance allows the recognition of the full amount of change in the fair value in profit or loss only if the presentation of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. That determination is made at initial recognition and is not reassessed. [IFRS 9, paragraphs 5.7.7-5.7.8]

Amounts presented in other comprehensive income shall not be subsequently transferred to profit or loss, the entity may only transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

equityiNstrumnt:`
All equity investments in scope of IFRS 9 are to be measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, with value changes recognised in profit or loss, except for those equity investments for which the entity has elected to present value changes in 'other comprehensive income'. There is no 'cost exception' for unquoted equities.
`,
ocioption:`
If an equity investment is not held for trading, an entity can make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to measure it at FVTOCI with only dividend income recognised in profit or loss. [IFRS 9, paragraph 5.7.5]
