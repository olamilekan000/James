IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires disclosure of information about the significance of financial instruments to an entity, and the nature and extent of risks arising from those financial instruments, both in qualitative and quantitative terms. Specific disclosures are required in relation to transferred financial assets and a number of other matters.

IFRS 7 was originally issued in August 2005 and applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
`,
Disclosure:`
IFRS requires certain disclosures to be presented by category of instrument based on the IAS 39 measurement categories. Certain other disclosures are required by class of financial instrument. For those disclosures an entity must group its financial instruments into classes of similar instruments as appropriate to the nature of the information presented. [IFRS 7.6]

The two main categories of disclosures required by IFRS 7 are:

- information about the significance of financial instruments. 
- information about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments

TransferredFinancialSssetsThatAreDerecognisedInTheirEntirety:`
Required disclosures include the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognised, fair value of the assets and liabilities that represent continuing involvement, maximum exposure to loss from the continuing involvement as well as maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to repurchase the derecognised financial assets. [IFRS 7.42E]

Additional disclosures are required for any gain or loss recognised at the date of transfer of the assets, income or expenses recognise from the entity's continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets as well as details of uneven distribution of proceed from transfer activity throughout the reporting period. [IFRS 7.42G]
`,
TransferredFinancialSssetsThatAreNotDerecognisedInTheirEntirety:`
Required disclosures include description of the nature of the transferred assets, nature of risk and rewards as well as description of the nature and quantitative disclosure depicting relationship between transferred financial assets and the associated liabilities. [IFRS 7.42D]
`,
transferOfFinAss:`
An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements:
- to understand the relationship between transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety and the associated liabilities; and
- to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity's continuing involvement in derecognised financial assets. [IFRS 7 42B]
`,
MarketRisk:`
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. Market risk reflects interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risks. [IFRS 7. Appendix A]

Disclosures about market risk include:
- a sensitivity analysis of each type of market risk to which the entity is exposed 
- additional information if the sensitivity analysis is not representative of the entity's risk exposure (for example because exposures during the year were different to exposures at year-end).
- IFRS 7 provides that if an entity prepares a sensitivity analysis such as value-at-risk for management purposes that reflects interdependencies of more than one component of market risk (for instance, interest risk and foreign currency risk combined), it may disclose that analysis instead of a separate sensitivity analysis for each type of market risk

`,
LiquidityRisk:`
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will have difficulties in paying its financial liabilities. [IFRS 7. Appendix A]

Disclosures about liquidity risk include: [IFRS 7.39]
- a maturity analysis of financial liabilities
- description of approach to risk management
