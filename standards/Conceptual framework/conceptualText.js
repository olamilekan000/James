overview:`
The Framework's purpose is to assist the IASB in developing and revising IFRSs that are based on consistent concepts, to help preparers to develop consistent accounting policies for areas that are not covered by a standard or where there is choice of accounting policy, and to assist all parties to understand and interpret IFRS. [SP1.1]

In the absence of a Standard or an Interpretation that specifically applies to a transaction, management must use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is relevant and reliable. In making that judgement, IAS 8.11 requires management to consider the definitions, recognition criteria, and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses in the Framework. This elevation of the importance of the Framework was added in the 2003 revisions to IAS 8.

The Framework is not a Standard and does not override any specific IFRS. [SP1.2]

If the IASB decides to issue a new or revised pronouncement that is in conflict with the Framework, the IASB must highlight the fact and explain the reasons for the departure in the basis for conclusions. [SP1.3]

Scope:`
The Framework addresses:
(i) - the objective of general purpose financial reporting
(ii) - qualitative characteristics of useful financial information
(iii) - financial statements and the reporting entity 
(iv) - the elements of financial statements recognition and derecognition 
(v) - measurement 
(iv) - presentation and disclosure 
(vi) - concepts of capital and capital maintenance
`,
objOfGenPurFin:`
The primary users of general purpose financial reporting are present and potential investors, lenders and other creditors, who use that information to make decisions about buying, selling or holding equity or debt instruments, providing or settling loans or other forms of credit, or exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise influence, management’s actions that affect the use of the entity’s economic resources. [1.2]

The primary users need information about the resources of the entity not only to assess an entity's prospects for future net cash inflows but also how effectively and efficiently management has discharged their responsibilities to use the entity's existing resources (i.e., stewardship). [1.3-1.4]

The IFRS Framework notes that general purpose financial reports cannot provide all the information that users may need to make economic decisions. They will need to consider pertinent information from other sources as well. [1.6]

The IFRS Framework notes that other parties, including prudential and market regulators, may find general purpose financial reports useful. However, these are not considered a primary user and general purpose financial reports are not primarily directed to regulators or other parties. [1.10]
`,
econResAndClaim:`
Information about the nature and amounts of a reporting entity's economic resources and claims assists users to assess that entity's financial strengths and weaknesses; to assess liquidity and solvency, and its need and ability to obtain financing. Information about the claims and payment requirements assists users to predict how future cash flows will be distributed among those with a claim on the reporting entity. [1.13]

A reporting entity's economic resources and claims are reported in the statement of financial position. [See IAS 1.54-80A]
`,
changInEcnReso:`
Changes in a reporting entity's economic resources and claims result from that entity's performance and from other events or transactions such as issuing debt or equity instruments. Users need to be able to distinguish between both of these changes. [1.15]
`,
finPerfReflecByAccrualAccounting:`
Information about a reporting entity's financial performance during a period, representing changes in economic resources and claims other than those obtained directly from investors and creditors, is useful in assessing the entity's past and future ability to generate net cash inflows. Such information may also indicate the extent to which general economic events have changed the entity's ability to generate future cash inflows. [1.18-1.19]

The changes in an entity's economic resources and claims are presented in the statement of comprehensive income. [See IAS 1.81-105]
`,
finPerfRefByCF:`
Information about a reporting entity's cash flows during the reporting period also assists users to assess the entity's ability to generate future net cash inflows and to assess management’s stewardship of the entity’s economic resources. This information indicates how the entity obtains and spends cash, including information about its borrowing and repayment of debt, cash dividends to shareholders, etc. [1.20]

The changes in the entity's cash flows are presented in the statement of cash flows. [See IAS 7]
`,
chngwsInEconResnotResulFromFinPer:`
Information about changes in an entity's economic resources and claims resulting from events and transactions other than financial performance, such as the issue of equity instruments or distributions of cash or other assets to shareholders is necessary to complete the picture of the total change in the entity's economic resources and claims. [1.21]

The changes in an entity's economic resources and claims not resulting from financial performance is presented in the statement of changes in equity. [See IAS 1.106-110]
`,
infoAbtUseOfEcRes:`
Information about the use of the entity's economic resources also indicates how efficiently and effectively the reporting entity’s management has used these resources in its stewardship of those resources. Such information is also useful for predicting how efficiently and effectively management will use the entity’s economic resources in future periods and, hence, what the prospects for future net cash inflows are. [1.22]
`,
QualCharOfFS:`
Relevance and faithful representation are the fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful financial information. [2.5]

Relevance

Relevant financial information is capable of making a difference in the decisions made by users. Financial information is capable of making a difference in decisions if it has predictive value, confirmatory value, or both. The predictive value and confirmatory value of financial information are interrelated. [2.6-2.10]

Materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude (or both) of the items to which the information relates in the context of an individual entity's financial report. [2.11]

Faithful representation

General purpose financial reports represent economic phenomena in words and numbers. To be useful, financial information must not only be relevant, it must also represent faithfully the phenomena it purports to represent. Faithful representation means representation of the substance of an economic phenomenon instead of representation of its legal form only. [2.12]

A faithful representation seeks to maximise the underlying characteristics of completeness, neutrality and freedom from error. [2.13]

A neutral depiction is supported by the exercise of prudence. Prudence is the exercise of caution when making judgements under conditions of uncertainty. [2.16]

While applying the fundamental qualitative characteristics, information must be both relevant and faithfully represented if it is to be useful. [2.20]
`,
EhncingQualitativeChar:`
Comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability are qualitative characteristics that enhance the usefulness of information that is relevant and faithfully represented. [2.23]

Comparability

Information about a reporting entity is more useful if it can be compared with a similar information about other entities and with similar information about the same entity for another period or another date. Comparability enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences among, items. [2.24-2.25]

Verifiability

Verifiability helps to assure users that information represents faithfully the economic phenomena it purports to represent. Verifiability means that different knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful representation. [2.30]

Timeliness

Timeliness means that information is available to decision-makers in time to be capable of influencing their decisions. [2.33]

Understandability

Classifying, characterising and presenting information clearly and concisely makes it understandable. While some phenomena are inherently complex and cannot be made easy to understand, to exclude such information would make financial reports incomplete and potentially misleading. Financial reports are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information with diligence. [2.34-2.36]

while applying the enhancing qualitative characteristics, enhancing qualitative characteristics should be maximised to the extent necessary. However, enhancing qualitative characteristics (either individually or collectively) cannot render information useful if that information is irrelevant or not represented faithfully. [2.37]
`,
costConsOfUsefFS:`
Cost is a pervasive constraint on the information that can be provided by general purpose financial reporting. Reporting such information imposes costs and those costs should be justified by the benefits of reporting that information. The IASB assesses costs and benefits in relation to financial reporting generally, and not solely in relation to individual reporting entities. The IASB will consider whether different sizes of entities and other factors justify different reporting requirements in certain situations. [2.39, 2.43]
`,
objAndScopeOfFs:`
The objective of financial statements is to provide information about an entity's assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses that is useful to financial statements users in assessing the prospects for future net cash inflows to the entity and in assessing management's stewardship of the entity's resources. [3.2]

This information is provided in the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance as well as in other statements and notes. [3.3]
`,
reportNPeriod:`
Financial statements are prepared for a specified period of time and provide comparative information and under certain circumstances forward-looking information. [3.4-3.6]
`,
perspectiveInFS:`
Financial statements provide information about transactions and other events viewed from the perspective of the reporting entity as a whole and are normally prepared on the assumption that the reporting entity is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. [3.8-3.9]
`,
reporting_entity:`
A reporting entity is an entity that is required, or chooses, to prepare financial statements. It can be a single entity or a portion of an entity or can comprise more than one entity. A reporting entity is not necessarily a legal entity. [3.10]

Determining the appropriate boundary of a reporting entity is driven by the information needs of the primary users of the reporting entity’s financial statements. [3.13-3.14]

Consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements

Generally, consolidated financial statements are more likely to provide useful information to users of financial statements than unconsolidated financial statements. [3.18]
`,
elementsOfFS:`
(i) - Assets
(ii) - liabilities
(iii) - Equity
(iv) - income
(v) - Expenses
`,
Assets:`
A present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events. An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits.
`,
liab:`
A present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events.
`,
equity:`
The residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.
`,
income:`
Increases in assets or decreases in liabilities that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity claims
`,
Expenses:` Decreases in assets or increases in liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to holders of equity claims.
New is the introduction of a separate definition of an economic resource to move the references to future flows of economic benefits out of the definitions of an asset and a liability. The expression "economic resource" instead of simply "resource" stresses that the IASB no longer thinks of assets as physical objects but as sets of rights. The definitions of asets and liabilities also no longer refer to "expected" inflows or outflows. Instead, the definition of an economic resource refers to the potential of an asset/liability to produce/to require a transfer of economic benefits. Distinguishing between liabilities and equity is not part of the new framework but has been transferred to the IASB's research project on financial instruments with the characteristics of equity.`
