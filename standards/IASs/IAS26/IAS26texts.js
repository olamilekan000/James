IAS 26 Accounting and Reporting by Retirement Benefit Plans outlines the requirements for the preparation of financial statements of retirement benefit plans. It outlines the financial statements required and discusses the measurement of various line items, particularly the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits for defined benefit plans.

IAS 26 was issued in January 1987 and applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 1988.
`,
obj:`
The objective of IAS 26 is to specify measurement and disclosure principles for the reports of retirement benefit plans. All plans should include in their reports a statement of changes in net assets available for benefits, a summary of significant accounting policies and a description of the plan and the effect of any changes in the plan during the period.

It is an arrangement by which an entity provides benefits (annual income or lump sum) to employees after they terminate from service. [IAS 26.8]

reportDefinedContributionPlan:`
The report of a defined benefit plan should contain either: [IAS 26.17]

(a) - a statement that shows the net assets available for benefits, the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits (distinguishing between vested benefits and non-vested benefits) and the resulting excess or deficit; or 
(b) - a statement of net assets available for benefits, including either a note disclosing the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits (distinguishing between vested benefits and non-vested benefits) or a reference to this information in an accompanying actuarial report.

If an actuarial valuation has not been prepared at the date of the report of a defined benefit plan, the most recent valuation should be used as a base and the date of the valuation disclosed. The actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits should be based on the benefits promised under the terms of the plan on service rendered to date, using either current salary levels or projected salary levels, with disclosure of the basis used. The effect of any changes in actuarial assumptions that have had a significant effect on the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits should also be disclosed. [IAS 26.18]

The report should explain the relationship between the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits and the net assets available for benefits, and the policy for the funding of promised benefits. [IAS 26.19]

Retirement benefit plan investments should be carried at fair value. For marketable securities, fair value means market value. If fair values cannot be estimated for certain retirement benefit plan investments, disclosure should be made of the reason why fair value is not used. [IAS 26.32]
