overview:`
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts permits an entity which is a first-time adopter of International Financial Reporting Standards to continue to account, with some limited changes, for 'regulatory deferral account balances' in accordance with its previous GAAP, both on initial adoption of IFRS and in subsequent financial statements. Regulatory deferral account balances, and movements in them, are presented separately in the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and specific disclosures are required.

IFRS 14 was originally issued in January 2014 and applies to an entity's first annual IFRS financial statements for a period beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
`,
Objective:`
The objective of IFRS 14 is to specify the financial reporting requirements for 'regulatory deferral account balances' that arise when an entity provides good or services to customers at a price or rate that is subject to rate regulation. [IFRS 14:1]
`,
scope:`
IFRS 14 is permitted, but not required, to be applied where an entity conducts rate-regulated activities and has recognised amounts in its previous GAAP financial statements that meet the definition of 'regulatory deferral account balances' (sometimes referred to 'regulatory assets' and 'regulatory liabilities'). [IFRS 14.5]
When applied, the requirements of IFRS 14 must be applied to all regulatory deferral account balances arising from an entity's rate-regulated activities. [IFRS 14.8]
`,
RegulatoryDeferralAccountBalance:`
The balance of any expense (or income) account that would not be recognised as an asset or a liability in accordance with other Standards, but that qualifies for deferral because it is included, or is expected to be included, by the rate regulator in establishing the rate(s) that can be charged to customers
`,
RateRegulator:`
An authorised body that is empowered by statute or regulation to establish the rate or range of rates that bind an entity. The rate regulator may be a third-party body or a related party of the entity, including the entity's own governing board, if that body is required by statute or regulation to set rates both in the interest of customers and to ensure the overall financial viability of the entity
`,
rateRegulation:`
A framework for establishing the prices that can be charged to customers for goods and services and that framework is subject to oversight and/or approval by a rate-regulator
`,
acctingPoliciesForDefferal:`
IFRS 14 provides an exemption from paragraph 11 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors when an entity determines its accounting policies for regulatory deferral account balances. [IFRS 14.9] Paragraph 11 of IAS 8 requires an entity to consider the requirements of IFRSs dealing with similar matters and the requirements of the Conceptual Framework when setting its accounting policies.

The effect of the exemption is that eligible entities can continue to apply the accounting policies used for regulatory deferral account balances under the basis of accounting used immediately before adopting IFRS ('previous GAAP') when applying IFRSs, subject to the presentation requirements of IFRS 14 [IFRS 14.11].

Entities are permitted to change their accounting policies for regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with IAS 8, but only if the change makes the financial statements more relevant and no less reliable, or more reliable and not less relevant, to the economic decision-making needs of users of the entity's financial statements. However, an entity is not permitted to change accounting policies to start to recognise regulatory deferral account balances. [IFRS 14.13]
`,
Disclosures:`
IFRS 14 sets out disclosure objectives to allow users to assess: [IFRS 14.27]
- the nature of, and risks associated with, the rate regulation that establishes the price(s) the entity can charge customers for the goods or services it provides - including information about the entity's rate-regulated activities and the rate-setting process, the identity of the rate regulator(s), and the impacts of risks and uncertainties on the recovery or reversal of regulatory deferral balance accounts
- the effects of rate regulation on the entity's financial statements - including the basis on which regulatory deferral account balances are recognised, how they are assessed for recovery, a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the reporting period, discount rates applicable, income tax impacts and details of balances that are no longer considered recoverable or reversible.
